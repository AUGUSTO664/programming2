This is the first work for this unit 1. we are going to describe 
programming paradigms and how solve problems using the as a source.

# UNIT 1
 
## Classification of programming paradigms

<h3>Characteristics of the Classification of  Programming Paradigms</h3>

A[programming paradigm](https://digitalfellows.commons.gc.cuny.edu/2018/03/12/an-introduction-to-programming-paradigms/) is a philosophy, style, or general approach to writing code. Most definitions of the term are so broad as to be fairly useless—the term tends to make more sense when discussing specific paradigms. Here, we’ll be comparing three specific paradigms: imperative, functional, and object-oriented.

If you’ve done programming in Python or C, you’ve used imperative programming. Imperative programming defines the solution to a problem as a series of steps—first do this, then do that, then do the next thing, and so on. The computer steps through each line of code, executing it and moving on to the next step. Programs written in the imperative style often resemble recipes—first crack the eggs, then mix in the flour, then add water. Imperative programs often change the state of the program on each line, assigning new variables and referring to or changing old ones. Though intuitive for solving small problems, imperative programs quickly become unmanageable as they become larger.


## Prgramming Languages 

A _Prgramming Language_ is a vocabulary and set of grammatical rules for 
instructing a computer or computer device to perfom specific tasks. the term
ussually refers to hihg-level languages such as BASIC, C, C++, COBOL, FORTRAN,
Ada and pascal 

Eah programming language has a unique set of keywords (words that it 
understands) and a especial syntax for organizing program instructions.
